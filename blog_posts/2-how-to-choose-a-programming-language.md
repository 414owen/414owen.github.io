### For a hackathon

The language in which you can get it done in the fastest. Screw best practices,
get you some loosely typed, garbage-collected action. Heck,  be a script kiddie
if you have to :)

Rationale: Time is the limiting factor, so just get it done.

e.g. JavaScript, Python, Ruby

### For a small project

The language you'll learn the most from. Get you some recursive, mathematical,
first-class function-y, pure, shiny, bright-eyed, weirdo of a language.

Rationale:  If you can't hack it (in the non-technical sense of the term), it's
no big deal, it's a small project, at least you pushed yourself in the vague
direction of betterment.

e.g. Idris, Haskell, Scheme

### For a large project

The language that will lead to the most maintainable codebase. Get you some
typechecked, strongly opinionated, bastardly compile-time checked or failsafe
language that has lots of docs and libraries. Make sure your build pipeline is
small. The less custom-tooling you have, the less your developers will jump
ship. Don't use your weird-ass custom coding standard either. Use the one that
the majority of people programming in that language use. Your aim is to
maximize the amount of people not pissed off at your choices.

Rationale: Common sense.

e.g. Rust, Erlang
