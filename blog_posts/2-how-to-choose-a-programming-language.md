### How to choose a language

#### For a hackathon

The language that you can get it done in the fastest
ie. JavaScript

### For a small project

The language you'll learn the most from
ie. Idris/Haskell/Scheme

### For a large project

The language that will lead to the most maintainable codebase
idk tbh
