The following is a speech I gave to a startup incubator in my university for a
pitching competition. On the train in I wrote the following manifesto.

---

Ladies and gentlemen, investors, we are MiniTrue, and we are the future.

We have created a neural network that classifies fake news. This is the first
step on the path to our end goal. What is the sole aim of our business? To own
a monopoly on the truth.

What does it mean, to own a monopoly on the truth? Let's go through the new
content creation workflow of a news outlet post-us:

* Content creator writes article
* Our product runs that article through our neural network. We do this without
  the consent of the news outlet, as they're words in the public domain. All
  we're doing is judging them
* This article's truth values are posted on our publicly viewable website
* The content publisher is notified that a web badge is available for their
  article, with our validation score
* If the article gets a good score, the creator pays us, and puts our badge on
  their article
* If the article gets a bad score, the creator puts their face in their hands,
  and weeps that they have intentionally tried to mislead the people

Like this, we will gain proceeds from any well-written article, and we will
prevent misleading information from ever being published.

Why will this ever be adopted, or dare I say, embraced?

It will be embraced because everyone's competitors will be using us.

First we scrape all articles from all outlets, and put up public scores for
them.

Our conversion to legitimacy will start with a tiny news outlet, let's say, the
University Times, for example. They will write an article comparing the scores
of various other news outlets. Why will they do this? Because they're starved
for stories and will write about anything.

From here, the public picks up the slack. Every idiot on every semi-serious
website will use our score to verify some misguided point or other. We will
spark flame wars. We will go viral.

From there on, small-scale operations will use our product to wage a bitter
truth war on each other. With these using us, it won't take much to convince a
major outlet to use us to verify a major story.

When we're being used by major news outlets to judge their own, or others'
stories, we will gain international renown. That's the advantage of having a
product that has to be mentioned by every article, every news report. It makes
advertising quite easy.

With this newly-gained notoriety, the power will go to our heads, our egos will
demand constant attention, and anyone who provides such will gain our favour.

We will inevitable let the power, fame and riches get to us. It will start with
a favour for a friend. An article's score will be adjusted to make someone's
life slightly easier. We won't think twice about it. This leads to a downward
spiral of bribery and corruption. Before we realise that our values have left
us, we'll be selling truth validation to the highest bidder, to the Trumps and
Clintons of the world. If you thought Rupert Murdoch had power, wait until he
has to pay us for his power to be validated.

Our company is called MiniTrue, after the ministry of truth from Orwell's 1984.
Our truth is the only truth. People will only believe something if we tell them
to believe it. After all, how could we be lying?

So, one question remains, ladies and gentlemen, which is, why should you care?
Well, we have an excellent investment opportunity lined up for you. We are
looking for three million euro, for zero percent of our business. Why zero
percent, you ask? Because we have no need of your help whatsoever. Our
marketing is free, we built the product ourselves over a weekend, and we will
be profitable within a month. In other words, this will all happen with or
without you, but investing in us would make you our friend, and we reward our
friends.

As a great person once said: "They trust me, the dumb fucks!". That person
currently owns a monopoly on the truth.
